## Summary

## About

This is the repository for [Nickgismokato.com](https://nickgismokato.com). This repo will **only** contain the source code for the website. All data the website will contain will not be put onto the repo. Furthermore the `oauth` credentials and the tokens will also not be uploaded to the repo.

### About the website

This website is a product created out of four needs:

1. Learning [Blazorise](https://blazorise.com/) for `.Net8.0` with `Bootstrap5`.
2. Creating a website which contain my achievements and my qualifications.
3. Creating a webservice for the guild `New Reunion` to help them simplify their logging experience with [Warcraftlogs](https://warcraftlogs.com) such that their excel work get simplified. A general `GraphQL` query can be created for anyone just looking for some specific data.
4. A place where I can contain my documentations for [SaTyR](https://www.satyr.dk/)

Furthermore this website will contain some of my own webservices.
